Thanks for purchasing this Black+White theme.  The fonts used in this theme are Swiss Light, Swiss Heavy and Swiss Bold.  You can find the Swiss family of fonts here - http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/swiss-721/

If you don't have Swiss, you can try using Helvetica which has a similar look and feel.  Helvetica Neue comes with thin, heavy etc.   Otherwise you can try finding similar styled fonts that are freely available like District Thin - http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2006/11/29/district-thin-free-font-of-the-week/


Aside from the font, the main things you need to keep in mind when using this template is to keep everything aligned properly - so line up the edges of text blocks and headings and the thin lines.  Also keep the spacing nicely proportioned.

Enjoy the template!
